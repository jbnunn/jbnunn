## Hello ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘‹ I'm @jbnunn 
- ðŸŒ± My first language was BASIC. Through the years my favorite languages have been PHP -> Ruby -> Python. I tried liking Rust, but it hasn't worked out (yet).
- ðŸ¤– I used to build robots and create neural networks. These days I'm more into building apps that use LLMs.
- ðŸ““ My main blog is https://www.jeffnunn.com/. I have an older one at https://bootsequence.net/
