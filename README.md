## ğŸ¤˜ Hello 

- ğŸ‘‹ I'm @jbnunn
- ğŸ“¦ I work at AWS but the code here is mine, just like my opinions.
- ğŸŒ± My first coding language was BASIC. Through the years my favorite languages have been BASIC â®• PHP â®• Ruby â®• Python.
- ğŸ¤– A lot of these repos are from a time when I hacked around on hardware, built robots, and built models for autonomous driving and navigation.
