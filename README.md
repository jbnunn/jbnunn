## Hello 👋

- 👋 I'm @jbnunn 
- 🌱 My first language was BASIC. Through the years my favorite languages have been PHP -> Ruby -> Python. I tried liking Rust, but it hasn't worked out (yet).
- 🤖 A lot of these repos are from a time when hacked around on hardware, built robots, and researched autonomous driving.
- 📓 My main blog is https://www.jeffnunn.com/. I have an older one at https://bootsequence.net/.

## Configuration Files

This repository contains my personal configuration files and dotfiles:

### 📝 [Neovim Configuration](./nvim/)
My complete Neovim setup using LazyVim with custom modifications for development work.

### 🔧 Other Configurations
Additional configuration files will be organized in the `other-configs/` directory as needed.

## Usage

Each configuration directory contains its own README with installation and usage instructions.
