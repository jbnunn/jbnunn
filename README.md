## ðŸ¤˜ Hello 

- ðŸ‘‹ I'm @jbnunn
- ðŸ“¦ I work at AWS but the code here is mine, just like my opinions.
- ðŸŒ± My first coding language was BASIC. Through the years my favorite languages have been BASIC â®• PHP â®• Ruby â®• Python.
  - Scala was cool, but I don't really need it much anymore.
  - C# has been nice to use while building things in Unity!
  - JavaScript is useful when I need it, but the JS tooling ecosystem is wacky.
  - Tried liking Rust, but it just doesn't do it for me.
- ðŸ¤– A lot of these repos are from a time when I hacked around on hardware, built robots, and built models for autonomous driving and navigation.
- ðŸ““ You can read my blog at https://www.jeffnunn.com/.
