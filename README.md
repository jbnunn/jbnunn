## Hello ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘‹ I'm @jbnunn 
- ðŸŒ± My first language was BASIC. Through the years my favorite languages have been PHP -> Ruby -> Python. I tried liking Rust, but it hasn't worked out (yet).
- ðŸ¤– A lot of these repos are from a time when I hacked around on hardware, built robots, and built tools for autonomous driving.
- ðŸ•’ I believe Git commits should be past tense, not present (sorry https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3580013/should-i-use-past-or-present-tense-in-git-commit-messages)
- ðŸ““ My main blog is https://www.jeffnunn.com/. I have an older one at https://bootsequence.net/.
