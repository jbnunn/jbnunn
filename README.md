## 🤘 Hello 

- 👋 I'm @jbnunn
- I work at AWS but the code here is mine, just like my opinions.
- My first coding language was BASIC. Through the years my favorite languages have been BASIC ⮕ PHP ⮕ Ruby ⮕ Python. 
- A lot of my repos are from a time when I hacked around on hardware, built robots, and trained machine learning models for autonomous driving and navigation.
- You can read my blog at [https://www.jeffnunn.com/](https://www.jeffnunn.com).
- My [dotfiles](https://github.com/jbnunn/dotfiles) contain configurations for my favorite tools.
- I run a highly customized macOS desktop on a MacBook Pro with an M3 Max

## My setup

I've customized macOS to feel more like Arch Linux while keeping the benefits of Mac hardware.
